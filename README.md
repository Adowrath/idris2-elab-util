# idris2-elab-util

Utilities and documentation for exploring Idirs 2 elaborator reflection.
For a tutorial-ish introduction, [start here](/src/Doc/Meta.md).

Part of the utilities in this package as well as some of my understanding
of elaborator reflection in Idris came from
the [idris2-elab-deriving](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/idris2-elab-deriving)
package.

## Docs and Tutorial

Most tutorials in this repository are themselves literate Idris files.
In order to typecheck or build those, package file elab-util-docs.ipkg
is provided.
