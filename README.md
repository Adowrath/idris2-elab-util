# idris2-elab-util

Utilities and documentation for exploring idirs2's new elaborator reflection.
For a tutorial-ish introduction, [start here](/src/Doc/Meta.md).

Part of the utilities in this package as well as some of my understanding
of elaborator reflection in idris came from
the [idris2-elab-deriving](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/idris2-elab-deriving)
package.
